# Snake 2D 🎮

A modern take on the classic Snake game — featuring a vertically split black-and-white screen, dynamic color transitions, and a polished UI. Built in Unity, this game challenges players with a stylish twist on retro gameplay.

  All in-game elements respond seamlessly to side shifts, creating a minimal yet visually striking experience.
